# Transcript of email between David and client

Hi David,
It was a pleasure to meet you today and as we briefly discussed on the phone, we would like to develop/introduce a new job board in Asia to challenge the existing players, which we feel are using old technology and offer very average service.  You may be able to have a look at www.jobsdb.com (owned by www.seek.com.au) and www.indeed.com.
What we have noticed is that from the front end, each job board is similar, however, I am certain that company have their own matching algorithm used for matching candidates to job post and for employers/recruiters to search database for candidate profile and CV.

Most job boards (inc JobsDB, Seek and Indeed) will include the following:

*Candidates*
Login with email verification (more advanced sites would offer LinkedIn, FB, Google login)
Candidate profile creation – job preferences, experience, education, skills
Document upload – CV, certifications
Job alert criteria setting with email notification
Job search – keyword, location, industry, job function, job type, pay range etc
Apply via the website or direct applicant to employer’s website via URL
Application history – jobs applied etc

*Employers/Recruiters*
Company profile creation first with company registration certificate upload and/or website verification and also main company login with email verification
Company profile page – Who are we, Values and Culture.  Also show company logo and photo
Job post creation – Company overview, job description, job requirements, skills requirement, salary range etc
Candidate search and filtering – only basic profile information is displayed and employers must pay before they can download CV and see personal information
Pre-screening questions and process when applicants apply for the job
Job Board Dashboard (in-buit Applicant Tracking System “ATS”)– showing Job Post, #views, #applications, open/closed/pending.  Can view all applicants that have applied, their profile details, CV and can determine next steps.  The dashboard is used to track the hiring process until closure.  It can also provide employers metrics on how successful their job post is.
Multiple company account access

*Example of features we plan to include are:*
Video features
In-mail features
AI for improved searching, matching and filtering
Gamification to increase engagement with candidate
Multi-lingual
Dashboard for candidate to provide them more transparency of the job process

In addition, I have included the demo site of the company that can sell one-time license.  You will see that they also provide the basic features mentioned above.  The only problem is that they only support English.

<https://www.jobboardfire.com>, whose biggest user/client is <https://jobs.girlboss.com/>, which adopts a cleaner and more dynamic search that I have not seen elsewhere.
